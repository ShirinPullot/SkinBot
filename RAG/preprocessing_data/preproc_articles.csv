skin healthy and clean ? cleansercleanser is what you ’ ll use to wash your face and it ’ s important to use a product intended for your face – not just whatever bar or body wash you have lying around . you ’ ll want to wash your face gently and take care not to scrub too hard . then , rinse with warm water , because hot water remove natural oil and cause your skin to become dehydrated.finding the right cleanser for you may be a process of trial and error . if you have dry skin , you ’ ll want to use one without alcohol or fragrance . if your skin tends to be oily , you ’ ll want to look for an

from drying out , leaving your skin hydrated and smooth . they are most effective when applied while your skin is slightly damp to seal in moisture.sunscreensome moisturizers includespf , but it doesn ’ t hurt to double up with sunscreen a well – particularly if your moisturizer ha an spf below . by now , you should know the line well : apply sunscreen every day , even when it ’ s gray or cold , even when you ’ re covered up . when you are exposed , reapply every two hour . make sure your sunscreen protects against both uva and uvb ray . if skin cancer and sun damage aren ’ t enough to convince you , uv exposure is also thenumber onecause of wrinkle , uneven skin tone , loss of firmness and aging signs.exfoliationhere ’ s a product you might not need or want to apply every day . if you have dry skin , including winter-air-induced dry skin , you may exfoliate more than usual , but you should still keep it to once or twice a week – max . exfoliation can be used after cleanser but before moisturizer , a it help to remove flaky skin by increasing skin cell turnover . the benefit are real – removing dead skin and buildup for smoother skin and clearer pore – but most dermatologist

doing what for your skin is to think of it like this : morning skin care should focus on prevention and protection for the day and your nighttime routine should focus on cleansing and repair.most people will only need to really wash their face once a day . in the morning , rinsing with warm water before applying moisturizer and sunscreen should suffice , while at night , after a full day of exposure and damage , more dedicated care is recommended . a such , before bed , you should wash your face with a cleanser to remove dirt and makeup then use toner , exfoliant and serum if you so choose . in any case , always end with moisturizing.regardless of the time of day , you should also always wash your face after working out or working up a sweat , a sweat can clog pore and make acne worse . a a rule , remember to take your makeup off before bed and resist picking at your skin.what about the weatherseason ’ s change can bring about adjustment to your skin care and maybe the product you use , but it shouldn ’ t require any major overhaul of your routine.in the winter , it ’ s all about extra moisturizing . the cold weather contributes todryness ( a doe the heat from radiator ) and wind can chap skin too . you may want to shift to a more moisturizing cleanser to supplement your daily moisturizer.conversely , in the summer , your skin may be oilier and you can turn to an oil-free cleanser . sunscreen is a staple for all season , but it ’ s fair to adjust to a lighter weight for daily use in the summer month – just be sure to bring out the heavy-duty stuff for any concentrated time spent in the sun.furthermore , remember you don ’ t have to wait for the leaf to fall or the snow to melt to switch up your skin care routine . if your skin change – due to the environment , hormone or anything else – it ’ s totally fair to adjust your routine in kind . adermatologistis a great resource if you struggle to get a handle on your skin care . they can help
