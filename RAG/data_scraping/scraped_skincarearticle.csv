But I also don’t want to waste my time and money.Ads for anti-aging products often tout a clinical study backing them, which might make you think they’re worth your money. But there are few strong placebo-controlled, blinded randomized trials in humans for over-the-counter products — much less ones that weren’t sponsored by the brand profiting from them. Outcomes are often based on a subjective appearance of improvement, not on something measured microscopically. Personally, I’d like to see both.AdvertisementFor example, products like alpha hydroxy acids and antioxidants like vitamin C could help with aging skin, but the data behind them is not as solid as that for retinoids and sunscreen.Lots of trendy moisturizer ingredients, like ceramides or natural moisturizing factor,have more theoretical than hard data backing them.Hyaluronic acid, a potent skin hydrator, does have aplacebo-controlled randomized trialthat showed improved skin elasticity and roughness, but that study was sponsored by industry.Keep in mind that none of these products are the fountain of youth. But if you set realistic goals, incorporating topical treatments and focusing on prevention can get you on the path toward healthier, smoother skin.What to know about retinoidsRetinoids, which are compounds derived from vitamin A, have been well studied to reverse some of the damage from UV rays, boosting cell turnover and stimulating collagen to smoothen wrinkles and even out irregularities. They range from prescription-strength tretinoin to the less potent over-the-counter versions retinal and retinol.AdvertisementRemember:Share this articleShareYou only need a pea-sized amount.Many people find retinoids irritating to the skin so start applying it a few times a week and work up to a higher frequency.It’s very important to use sunscreen and moisturizer alongside retinoids.Retinoids take months to work, so set your expectations accordingly.Don’t take a retinoid if you’re pregnant or breastfeeding.Check the product’s instructions to make sure you’re applying it appropriately.What to know about sunscreenYou’ve probably heard you should wear sunscreen religiously before going outside and don wide-brimmed hats or clothing with built-in protection.Look for a sunscreen that is SPF 30 or more, and wear it every day — even when your plan is to sit in front of your computer working.“Remember, most sun damage is due to incidental exposure,” said Charlene Lam, an associate professor of dermatology at Penn State Health, in an email interview. “So not the times you are going to the beach, but when you are randomly out running errands or even sitting inside because UVA rays can still penetrate windows.”Here’s what else to know:Especially if you have adarker skin tone, look for a sunscreen with iron oxide, which Lam recommends to protect against visible light damage. We always talk about UV light, but visible light — from the sun, lightbulbs or electronic devices — candamage DNA in our skin through oxidative stress. People withdarker skin tones are more likely to experience hyperpigmentationbecause of it.Pricey doesn’t mean better. “I will see patients purchasing very expensive sunscreens and then only use a drop of it — that is counterproductive,” Lam said. Ageneral guidelineis to use about a half teaspoon for your face and neck.Don’t forget to apply sunscreen to your chest and hands.Already overwhelmed? Try a moisturizer with SPF built-in and save yourself a step.Skin care tips for all agesDespite the advice from TikTok gurus,you don’t need to exfoliate —that’s something your body does naturally. If your skin is dry and flaky, focus instead on moisturizing.If you aren’t already in a good exercise routine, this is your sign to start lifting weights: A study of sedentary middle-aged Japanese women found thateven 16 weeks of regularly exercisingimproved the elasticity and bolstered the extracellular matrix of facial skin. Lifting weights in particular boosted the dermal layer of the skin.Avoid smoking. Smokers have characteristic changes associated with accelerated skin aging, includinglower eyelid bags and upper lip wrinklesthat may be driven by poorer skin elasticity. Air pollution has also been shown to beassociated with premature skin agingin epidemiological studies.Sunglasses are not just for your eyes. You should wear a pair that offers UVA and UVB protection to protect the delicate skin around your eyes that is so prone to wrinkling.Mature skin tends to become drier (our sebaceous glands produce less oil with age) so a rich moisturizer can help.What I want my patients to knowWhen we’re talking about skin aging and sun damage, cancer is the most worrisome possibility we want to intervene on early.

1,"With a sharp increase in working from home during the COVID-19 pandemic, more people are noticing age-related skin changes up close on their videoconference calls.The good news? You don’t need to rush to the dermatologist for your anti-aging needs. The best skincare regimens to combat the cardinal signs of aging, which include uneven skin tone, fine lines, roughness, and dryness, can start from the comfort of your own home. You don’t need a prescription, time to get to a dermatologist, or deep pockets to score quality products.Here are a few science-backed, dermatologist-favorite ingredients that can help to slow, or even reverse, signs of aging. All of the ingredients listed below can be found over the counter (OTC) and are available in preparations that cost under $30.The problem? Uneven skin tone. The solution: Topical niacinamideNiacinamide, or vitamin B3, helps to block extra pigment formation by inhibiting the transfer of melanin (the major pigment in the skin) between skin cells. Applying topical niacinamide (5% concentration) twice a day was shown in arandomized and controlled, split-face trialto reduce freckles and sun spots in as soon as four weeks. The results were maintained throughout the eight-week treatment period. Anotherclinical studyshowed improvement of skin redness and sallowness (yellowing of the skin that occurs with age) in people who used topical niacinamide, resulting in a more even complexion. Niacinamide may also improveacneand fine lines.Topical niacinamide appears to be well tolerated, with no serious side effects.The problem? Fine lines. The solution: Topical retinoidsAging can contribute to gradual loss of vitamin A, a retinol, which naturally occurs in the skin. This can be replenished by vitamin A derivatives, known as topical retinoids. Topical retinoids, such asretinolandadapalene, are available over the counter. They have been shown to significantly improve fine wrinkles, likely due to increased skin collagen thickness with prolonged use. Other benefits of retinoids include improvement of dark spots and reduction of atypical skin cells that could lead to skin cancer.If you have acne or clogged pores, you may want to opt for adapalene, which appears to have more uptake in the follicles where acne starts, and also has anti-inflammatory effects. Both of these factors are important in acne formation. Adapalene may also be less irritating than some other retinoids.The most common side effects of topical retinoids are dryness, redness, and irritation. This can be mitigated by gradually increasing use (from every third night, to every other night, to nightly), or by avoiding use with other potentially irritating or abrasive products.Avoid topical retinoids if you are trying to get pregnant, or are currently pregnant or breastfeeding. Also make sure to use an SPF 30+ sunscreen on your face daily, due to increased sun sensitivity with this product.The problem? Rough or dull skin. The solution: Alpha-hydroxy acidsThe very top layers of skin, known as the stratum corneum, may increase in thickness with age, possibly because older cells are less able to renew and turn over. This can lead to skin roughness and can interfere with skin “glow” or luminosity. Alpha-hydroxy acids, such as glycolic acid or lactic acid, are naturally occurring substances that help to break down the bonds between cells in this top layer of skin, which results in smoother skin in as little as 24 hours. Over time, regular use may also improve fine lines, skin yellowing, blotchiness, and dark spots.Glycolic acid at concentrations of 30% or more is used in the dermatologist’s office as a peel. But there isevidencethat OTC preparations at concentrations of around 10% can give you real results and are safe to use at home.Alpha-hydroxy acids such as lactic acid can also be found in OTC body lotions. They help to smooth the skin from the neck down.The most common side effect is excess redness, and this can be made worse by using several new, irritating products at once.The problem? Dry skin. The solution: Hyaluronic acidAn important (but often overlooked) sign of aging skin is dryness. As we age, our skin naturally loses its ability to retain moisture. This is due to decreasing stores of hyaluronic acid, an important component of healthy skin that has the ability to suck in water. Replacing hyaluronic acid through topical serums or moisturizers may help to boost overall skin hydration. Hyaluronic acid can also improve the appearance of wrinkles and skin firmness.A few parting wordsStart slow. If you are new to skincare, you don’t want to start using all of these ingredients at once (this is especially true of using a retinoid and an alpha-hydroxy acid together). Begin in a stepwise fashion, and increase frequency or add additional products only as tolerated. Remember that improvements in skin appearance with any skincare regimen may be subtle and can take time.Once your skin has become accustomed to these ingredients, consider combination products that combine two or more of the ingredients you’re looking for. Finally, no skincare regimen is complete without good sun protection, so limit sun exposure, wear broad-brimmed hats and sunglasses when outside, and applydaily sunscreen.)For treatment of deep wrinkles or sagging skin, or for medical skin concerns, seek care from a board-certified dermatologist."
2,"Over the yearsthere’s been a wave of buzzy ways to quench dry, flaky skin. Social media is overflowing with trending terminology, including slugging, flooding, and moisture sandwich-ing. However, it can be overwhelming to navigate the many ways to deeply moisturize.We’re here to help break down the techniques, so you can decide which hydrating solution best fits your needs and routine.SluggingWe’re willing to bet that you’ve chanced upon this term while traversing TikTok. However, applying a vaseline (or aquaphor) mask on skin to lock in hydration has been a popular practice for decades. It’s often recognized as having K-beauty origins.Toslug, first cleanse skin and pat dry, then apply alightweight moisturizer. After that, add a dime-sized amount of vaseline or aquaphor to your skin as if you’re applying a face mask. Be sure not to layer it over actives, like retinol and exfoliants, as this can enhance the potency of these actives and increase irritation. Vaseline is an occlusive that forms a protective layer (it won’t clog your pores!) to prevent moisture loss. Slug while you sleep or leave on for 30 minutes then tissue it off for a more quenched and dewy base for your makeup routine.FloodingSkin floodingis exactly what it sounds like—quenching your skin with a wave of moisture. It’s all about layering hydrating products. Some skincare enthusiasts swear by building up to 10 moisturizing layers for ultimate softness. I personally prefer a simplified version that involves applying askin-quenching toner,hyaluronic-infused serum, andmoisturizer. Routines widely vary, but the concept remains the same— just keep layering!To flood, start by cleansing skin, but leave it slightly damp for better absorption. Then, apply toner, and follow up with your hyaluronic acid serum. This part is crucial as hyaluronic acid is a humectant that’ll help bind moisture to your skin. Finish up by applying moisturizer. If you’re flooding in the am, be sure to layer onSPF 30+.Moisture SandwichIf your skin is hungry for moisture and an instant glow that lasts all day, I recommend trying the moisture sandwich. Much like skin flooding, this routine varies and involves layering hydrating skincare products. The crucial step: spritz some added hydration in between layers with a facial mist.To build your moisture sandwich, first cleanse skin, then pat dry. Spritz on anantioxidant-rich facial mist, and don’t skimp. Follow up with ahyaluronic-infused serum, then another spray of mist. After that, go in with anultra-hydrating moisturizer."
3,"Healthy TipsDo You Really Need a Skin Care Routine?Understanding Skin Care for Your Daily HealthThe phrase skin care brings to mind three things:skin cancer,dry skinand a long aisle of beauty products at your local drugstore. But it’s more than a surface-level concern. While a skin care routine may sound like high maintenance, in reality, the steps for healthy skin are not only necessary, they’re easy to implement too.“Investing early in the health of your skin, with regular skin care, will not only better protect it from the harsh effects of winter, but also keep you looking and feeling your best throughout the year,” saysSteven Nwe, DO, a dermatologist with Northwestern Medicine. “The key to skin resiliency is knowing your skin and treating it well.”First, you’ll want to take into account your skin type. The primary skin types are dry, oily or combination and while your skin may get drier or oilier based on the season, the majority of the time it should be relatively consistent.What Belongs in Your Skin Care CabinetNext, you should know what makes up a healthy skin routine. Which is to say, what types ofproductsdo you really need to keep your skin healthy and clean?CleanserCleanser is what you’ll use to wash your face and it’s important to use a product intended for your face – not just whatever bar or body wash you have lying around. You’ll want to wash your face gently and take care not to scrub too hard. Then, rinse with warm water, because hot water removes natural oils and causes your skin to become dehydrated.Finding the right cleanser for you may be a process of trial and error. If you have dry skin, you’ll want to use one without alcohol or fragrance. If your skin tends to be oily, you’ll want to look for an oil-free option, and you may want to consider using a toner as well.TonerToner is applied after washing your face and can smooth, soften and calm skin. Toners often contain ingredients that replenish and restore nutrients to your skin and can diminish redness and dry patches.MoisturizerLike cleansers, moisturizers are for everyone and should be used every time you wash your face. And like cleansers, a little trial and error is totally normal when you’re looking for the right one – oily skin, for example, can benefit from lightweight, oil-free or gel products. Moisturizers prevent your skin from drying out, leaving your skin hydrated and smooth. They are most effective when applied while your skin is slightly damp to seal in moisture.SunscreenSome moisturizers includeSPF, but it doesn’t hurt to double up with sunscreen as well – particularly if your moisturizer has an SPF below 30. By now, you should know the lines well: Apply sunscreen every day, even when it’s gray or cold, even when you’re covered up. When you are exposed, reapply every two hours. Make sure your sunscreen protects against both UVA and UVB rays. If skin cancer and sun damage aren’t enough to convince you, UV exposure is also thenumber onecause of wrinkles, uneven skin tone, loss of firmness and aging signs.ExfoliationHere’s a product you might not need or want to apply every day. If you have dry skin, including winter-air-induced dry skin, you may exfoliate more than usual, but you should still keep it to once or twice a week – max. Exfoliation can be used after cleanser but before moisturizer, as it helps to removes flaky skin by increasing skin cell turnover. The benefits are real – removing dead skin and buildup for smoother skin and clearer pores – but most dermatologists will recommend chemical exfoliants over scrubs to prevent damage to the protective barrier of your skin.SerumAnother optional addition to your skin care routine, serums contain ingredients like antioxidants or retinol that support skin health in a number of ways, such as calming redness and improving texture and firmness.When You Should Use WhatThe easiest way to remember when you should be doing what for your skin is to think of it like this: Morning skin care should focus on prevention and protection for the day and your nighttime routine should focus on cleansing and repair.Most people will only need to really wash their face once a day. In the morning, rinsing with warm water before applying moisturizer and sunscreen should suffice, while at night, after a full day of exposure and damage, more dedicated care is recommended. As such, before bed, you should wash your face with a cleanser to remove dirt and makeup then use toner, exfoliant and serums if you so choose. In any case, always end with moisturizing.Regardless of the time of day, you should also always wash your face after working out or working up a sweat, as sweat can clog pores and make acne worse. As a rule, remember to take your makeup off before bed and resist picking at your skin.What About the WeatherSeason’s change can bring about adjustments to your skin care and maybe the products you use, but it shouldn’t require any major overhaul of your routine.In the winter, it’s all about extra moisturizing. The cold weather contributes todryness(as does the heat from radiators) and wind can chap skin too. You may want to shift to a more moisturizing cleanser to supplement your daily moisturizer.Conversely, in the summer, your skin may be oilier and you can turn to an oil-free cleanser. Sunscreen is a staple for all seasons, but it’s fair to adjust to a lighter weight for daily use in the summer months – just be sure to bring out the heavy-duty stuff for any concentrated time spent in the sun.Furthermore, remember you don’t have to wait for the leaves to fall or the snow to melt to switch up your skin care routine. If your skin changes – due to the environment, hormones or anything else – it’s totally fair to adjust your routine in kind.  Adermatologistis a great resource if you struggle to get a handle on your skin care. They can help suggest drugstore products, prescribe more serious help and provide lifestyle advice to help address other factors that may be affecting your skin.Adjusting for AgeGood skin care is essential at any age and healthy habits in your 20s and 30s can strengthen and prepare your skin for the effects of aging down the road. Skin has strong collagen and elastic production in your 20s and 30s. Cleanser and SPF moisturizer will be fixtures in your routine, and some dermatologists may recommend an over-the-counter retinol product or antioxidant serum as a preventative measure to stimulate collagen production. While you may associate collagen with keeping skin looking plump, it also gives skin its strength and structure and plays a role in the replacement of dead skin cells.As women enter the period before menopause (perimenopause) and menopause, their hormones are in flux and the natural forms of aging begin to kick in. While serums and creams that support collagen production may be added to their skin care arsenal, the foundation will remain a gentle cleanser and a strong moisturizer.Many factors can affect your skin and your skin – as your largest organ and first line of health defense – deserves to be protected. When considering skin care, you’ll want to be aware of your environment and daily health, such asdiet,stressandfitness. Still, at the end of the day, a skin care routine involving cleanser and moisturizer can go a long way.Related ServicesDermatologyFeatured ExpertsSteven M.
